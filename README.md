# drump_tweet_generator
The drump tweet generator uses a Markov chain to generate random tweet based off of past tweets from drump. It may not necessarily makes sense but on occasion spits out some hilarious tweets. I recommend running the Flask Application and trying it on your computer. 


Instructions to Install:

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your computer. 

git clone https://www.github.com/oliviersm199/drump_tweet_generator

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py

And you should have a running application at: http://127.0.0.1:5001
